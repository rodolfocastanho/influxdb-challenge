### To review

It was my first time working with InfluxDB, so I guess maybe there is a better way too ingest data than doing a for loop in a dict to write Point by Point.

Update: Probable Solution is Using sequence

```
sequence = ["mem,host=host1 used_percent=23.43234543",
            "mem,host=host1 available_percent=15.856523"]
write_api.write(bucket, org, sequence)
```
